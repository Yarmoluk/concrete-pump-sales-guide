# Glossary

## A

**Agitator** — A rotating paddle inside the hopper that keeps concrete moving and prevents clogging at the pump intake.

## B

**Boom** — The hydraulic articulating arm mounted on a pump truck that delivers concrete from the pump to the pour location. Boom lengths range from 28 to 70+ meters.

**Boom Pump** — A concrete pump mounted on a truck chassis with an articulating boom for placing concrete at height and distance.

## C

**Cutting Ring** — A wear component at the interface between the pumping valve and the delivery system. Replaced every 10,000–20,000 cubic yards.

**Concrete Pump** — A machine that transfers liquid concrete from a hopper to the placement location using hydraulic pressure through a pipeline.

**Cubic Yard** — The standard unit of measurement for concrete volume in North America. One cubic yard = 27 cubic feet.

## D

**Delivery Line** — The pipeline (boom pipe or ground line) through which concrete travels from the pump to the discharge point.

## H

**Hopper** — The funnel-shaped receptacle on the pump that receives concrete from the ready-mix truck and feeds it into the pumping mechanism.

## L

**Line Pump** — A trailer-mounted concrete pump that delivers concrete through ground-level hoses and pipes, without an articulating boom.

## O

**Outriggers** — Hydraulic stabilizing legs that extend from the truck to provide a stable base during boom pump operation.

## P

**Pour** — A single concrete placement operation at a job site.

**Prime** — The process of pumping a cement slurry or grout through the delivery lines before the main concrete pour, to lubricate the pipeline and prevent blockages.

**PSI (Pounds per Square Inch)** — The measure of pump output pressure. Higher PSI is required for longer distances, greater heights, and stiffer concrete mixes.

**PTO (Power Take-Off)** — A mechanical device that transfers engine power from the truck chassis to drive the hydraulic pump system.

**Pumping Hours** — The true measure of a concrete pump's usage, tracked by an hour meter that runs only when the pump is operating. More meaningful than odometer miles.

## R

**Ready-Mix** — Concrete that is batched at a central plant and delivered to the job site in a mixing truck. The concrete pump operator receives ready-mix and places it.

**Rock Valve** — Schwing's proprietary pumping valve technology, designed to reduce wear and improve performance with aggregate-heavy mixes.

## S

**S-Tube / S-Valve** — The primary pumping valve inside a concrete pump that alternates between two cylinders to create continuous concrete flow. A major wear component, replaced every 20,000–40,000 cubic yards.

**Section 179** — A provision in the U.S. tax code that allows businesses to deduct the full purchase price of qualifying equipment in the year of acquisition, rather than depreciating it over time.

**Slick Line** — Smooth-bore steel pipe used in the boom delivery system. The interior surface wears over time from abrasive concrete aggregate.

## T

**T880** — Kenworth's Class 8 vocational truck model, widely used as a chassis for concrete pump mounting due to its heavy-duty frame, set-back axle design, and high GVWR rating.

**TCO (Total Cost of Ownership)** — The complete cost of owning and operating equipment over its useful life, including acquisition, maintenance, wear parts, fuel, insurance, and eventual disposition.

## U

**Utilization Rate** — The percentage of available working hours that a pump is actually deployed on revenue-generating pours. A key profitability metric for pump operators.

## W

**Washout** — The process of cleaning concrete residue from the pump, hopper, and delivery lines after each pour. Proper washout prevents concrete hardening in the system.

**Wear Plates** — Hardened steel plates inside the pump housing that form the sealing surface for the S-tube. Replaced as they erode from concrete abrasion.

## Z

**Z-Fold** — A boom folding configuration where sections fold in a Z-pattern, allowing the boom to compact into a shorter length for transit and tight job site setups.
