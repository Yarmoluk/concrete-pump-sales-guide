# Chapter 5: Talking Like a Concrete Pro

## The First 30 Seconds

When you walk into a concrete pumping contractor's office, the first question in their mind is: *"Does this finance guy know anything about my business?"*

You don't need to be a pump operator. You need to know enough to ask **smart questions** and understand the answers.

## Essential Vocabulary

Use these terms naturally in conversation — they signal you've done your homework.

| Term | What It Means | How to Use It |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| **Boom** | The articulating arm that delivers concrete | *"What boom length are you running on your fleet?"* |
| **S-tube / S-valve** | The pumping valve inside the pump — a major wear component | *"When did you last swap the S-tube?"* |
| **Wear plates / cutting ring** | High-wear parts at the pumping interface | *"Are you sourcing OEM wear parts or aftermarket?"* |
| **Hopper** | Receives concrete from the ready-mix truck | *"How's the hopper holding up?"* |
| **Outriggers** | Stabilizing legs deployed during pumping | *"Do you run into tight setups where outrigger spread is an issue?"* |
| **Slick line / boom pipe** | The pipeline that carries concrete through the boom | *"How many yards before you rotate your boom pipe?"* |
| **Pumping hours** | The true usage metric (not odometer) | *"What kind of hours are you putting on per year?"* |
| **Yard** | Cubic yard — the standard unit for concrete volume | *"What's your average pour size in yards?"* |
| **Ready-mix** | The concrete delivered by mixing trucks | *"Who are your main ready-mix suppliers?"* |
| **PSI** | Pump output pressure | *"What pressure do you need for your typical pours?"* |
| **Pour** | A single concrete placement job | *"How many pours are you averaging per week?"* |
| **Washout** | Cleaning the pump and lines after each pour | *"How long does washout take your crew?"* |
| **Prime** | Pumping a slurry mix to lubricate lines before concrete | *"Do you prime with grout or use a primer ball?"* |

## Smart Questions That Build Credibility

### About Their Business

- *"How many units are you running right now?"*
- *"What's your mix of commercial vs. residential work?"*
- *"Are you seeing more high-rise or low-rise demand?"*
- *"What's your typical crew size per rig?"*
- *"How far in advance are your pours scheduled?"*

### About Their Equipment

- *"What brands are you running? Any preference?"*
- *"What boom lengths work best for your market?"*
- *"How are you handling maintenance — in-house or dealer?"*
- *"What's your parts lead time looking like?"*
- *"Any units getting close to rebuild or replacement?"*

### About Their Pain Points

- *"What's your biggest challenge keeping rigs in service?"*
- *"Are you turning down work because you don't have enough units?"*
- *"How are you handling the skilled operator shortage?"*
- *"What's your biggest cost outside of labor?"*

!!! tip "The Golden Question"
    *"If you could add one more rig to your fleet tomorrow, what would be the ideal setup?"*

    This question does three things: confirms they want to grow, reveals their preferences, and lets you position your available rig against their answer.

## What NOT to Say

| Don't Say This | Why | Say This Instead |
|---------------|-----|-----------------|
| "Concrete mixer" | That's the truck from the batch plant, not the pump | "Concrete pump" or "boom pump" |
| "Crane" when pointing at the boom | The boom is not a crane — different equipment entirely | "Boom" |
| "Gas mileage" | Nobody cares about MPG on a pump truck | "Fuel costs per shift" or "transit costs" |
| "It's basically new" | A 2017 is not new — be honest | "It's mid-life with plenty of production years ahead" |
| "I don't know much about pumps" | Kills credibility instantly | Ask a question instead — curiosity beats ignorance |
| "All pumps are basically the same" | Insults their expertise | "What differences matter most to you between brands?" |

## Reading the Customer

### The Owner-Operator

- Runs 1–3 rigs, probably operates one himself
- Knows every bolt on his equipment
- Cares about: reliability, parts cost, monthly payment
- **Approach**: Technical respect. Ask about his maintenance routine. He's proud of his rigs.

### The Fleet Manager

- Runs 5–20+ rigs, manages operators and maintenance
- Thinks in spreadsheets: utilization rates, cost per yard, fleet age
- Cares about: TCO, standardization, uptime percentage
- **Approach**: Business case. Show the numbers. Fleet managers buy ROI, not iron.

### The Contractor Moving into Pumping

- Currently subs out all pump work, paying $200/hr to someone else
- May not know pump specifications well
- Cares about: "Can I make money with this?" and "How hard is it to run?"
- **Approach**: Education + simplicity. Walk them through the economics. Offer to connect them with an experienced operator.

## The Conversation Flow

```
1. Build rapport → Ask about their business and fleet
2. Identify pain → Listen for capacity constraints or equipment issues
3. Bridge to solution → "That's actually why I reached out..."
4. Present the rig → Specs that match their stated needs
5. Handle objections → Use Chapter 4 responses
6. Propose next step → Site visit, spec sheet, financing preview
```

## Final Thought

You're not selling a truck. You're not selling a pump. You're selling **the ability to say yes to more pours**. Every conversation should come back to: *"This rig puts you in a position to take on more work and make more money."*

That's the message that wins in equipment finance.
