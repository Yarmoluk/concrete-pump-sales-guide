# Chapter 3: Truck-Mounted Boom Pumps — What Matters

## Anatomy of a Boom Pump Rig

A truck-mounted boom pump is two machines in one:

1. **The chassis** (truck) — drives the rig to the job site
2. **The pump + boom assembly** — the revenue-generating equipment mounted on the chassis

Both matter. A great pump on a broken truck makes zero dollars.

## The Chassis: Why the Kenworth T880 Matters

The **Kenworth T880** is a vocational workhorse — purpose-built for heavy-duty applications like concrete pumping.

| Feature | T880 Specification | Why It Matters |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Class** | Class 8 heavy-duty | Built for the weight of a boom pump assembly (20,000–40,000 lbs) |
| **Engine** | PACCAR MX-13 (typically 455–510 HP) | Reliable power for highway transit and PTO-driven pump hydraulics |
| **Frame** | Heavy-gauge steel rails | Handles the torsional stress of boom deployment |
| **Cab** | Set-back axle, day cab | Optimized for vocational mounting, good visibility |
| **GVWR** | Up to 92,000 lbs | Accommodates full pump assembly + outriggers |
| **Reputation** | Industry standard for pump trucks | Operators and mechanics know it — fewer surprises |

!!! info "Kenworth T880 vs Competitors"
    The T880 competes with the **Peterbilt 567**, **Mack Granite**, and **Western Star 4700**. All are capable, but the T880 is arguably the most common chassis under boom pumps in North America. Customers will recognize it immediately.

## The Pump: Key Specifications That Win or Lose Deals

### Output (Cubic Yards per Hour)

- Typical boom pump output: **80–200 cubic yards/hour**
- Higher output = faster pours = more revenue per shift
- Ask: *"What's your typical pour size?"* — this tells you if the pump matches their work

### Concrete Pressure (PSI)

- Range: **800–1,500 PSI** depending on model
- Higher pressure needed for: long horizontal distances, high vertical lifts, stiff mixes
- Decorative concrete and shotcrete require different pressure profiles

### Boom Length and Configuration

| Boom Class | Reach | Typical Use |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| 28m–33m | Short | Residential, small commercial |
| 36m–42m | Mid-range | Most commercial work, sweet spot |
| 47m–52m | Long | Multi-story, infrastructure |
| 56m+ | Extra-long | High-rise, specialty |

Boom configuration matters too:

- **Z-fold** — compact folding, good for tight job sites
- **Roll-fold (RZ)** — combines reach with compact storage
- **Multi-section** — 4 or 5 sections for maximum flexibility

### Hopper Size

- The hopper receives concrete from the ready-mix truck
- Larger hoppers (typically **0.5–1.0 cubic yard**) = less waiting between trucks
- Grate design matters — keeps rocks and debris out of the pump

### Outriggers

- Stabilize the truck during boom operation
- **Front and rear outrigger spread** determines the footprint needed on-site
- Customers care about: setup time, reach at partial deployment, ground pressure

## Wear Parts: The Ongoing Cost Story

These parts wear out regularly and represent the biggest maintenance cost:

| Wear Part | Replacement Interval | Approximate Cost |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Wear plates** | Every 10,000–20,000 cubic yards | $200–$600 |
| **Cutting ring** | Every 10,000–20,000 cubic yards | $300–$800 |
| **S-tube or S-valve** | Every 20,000–40,000 cubic yards | $1,500–$4,000 |
| **Delivery pipe/hose** | Varies by abrasion | $50–$300 per section |
| **Piston cups** | Every 15,000–30,000 cubic yards | $200–$500 |

!!! warning "Key Selling Point"
    When a customer asks about **total cost of ownership**, wear parts are the conversation. Concord's simpler design and North American parts availability can mean **20–30% lower wear part costs** vs. European manufacturers.

## What to Inspect on a Used Boom Pump

If a customer asks about the condition of your 2017 rig, know these inspection points:

1. **Boom pins and bushings** — worn pins = sloppy boom movement = safety concern
2. **Hydraulic cylinders** — check for leaks, scoring on rods
3. **Pump cylinders** — bore wear, piston condition
4. **Outrigger pads and cylinders** — cracks, leaks, wear
5. **Pipeline and clamps** — wall thickness, clamp condition
6. **Hopper and agitator** — wear on paddles, hopper walls
7. **Hour meter** — pumping hours tell the real story (not odometer miles)
8. **Chassis** — standard CDL truck inspection points
