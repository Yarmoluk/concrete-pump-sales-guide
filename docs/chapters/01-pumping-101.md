# Chapter 1: Concrete Pumping 101

## Why Concrete Pumps Exist

Concrete has a limited working window — typically **60–90 minutes** from the time it leaves the batch plant before it starts to set. Pumps solve the logistics problem of getting wet concrete from the truck to the pour location quickly and precisely.

Without a pump, crews rely on chutes, wheelbarrows, or crane-and-bucket methods — all slower, more labor-intensive, and less precise.

## The Two Main Pump Types

### Boom Pumps (Truck-Mounted)

- Mounted on a truck chassis (like the Kenworth T880)
- Have a **hydraulic articulating boom** (typically 28m–70m reach)
- Self-contained: drive to the job, unfold the boom, pump concrete
- Best for: high-rise pours, large commercial slabs, bridge decks, hard-to-reach placements
- **Cost range**: $300K–$800K+ depending on boom length and chassis

### Line Pumps (Trailer-Mounted)

- Smaller, towed behind a truck
- Concrete flows through ground-level hoses/pipes
- Best for: residential foundations, flatwork, swimming pools, smaller jobs
- **Cost range**: $80K–$250K

!!! tip "Sales Insight"
    Your rig is a **boom pump** — the higher-value, higher-capability category. Boom pump owners typically run larger operations and do commercial/infrastructure work.

## How the Business Works

Concrete pumping companies make money two ways:

1. **Hourly rate** — typically $150–$250/hour for a boom pump, with a 4-hour minimum
2. **Per-yard rate** — $15–$40 per cubic yard pumped

A busy boom pump can gross **$250K–$400K per year**. The economics work when utilization stays above ~60%.

## The Customer's Top Pain Points

| Pain Point | What It Means for You |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **Downtime** | A pump sitting broken = zero revenue. Reliability is everything. |
| **Maintenance costs** | Wear parts (S-tube/S-valve, wear plates, cutting rings) are expensive and frequent |
| **Boom reach limitations** | If the boom can't reach, they lose the job or need a second setup |
| **Pump pressure/output** | Higher PSI and cubic yard/hour output = faster pours = more jobs per day |
| **Operator quality** | Boom pumps require skilled operators — the truck is only as good as the person running it |
| **Chassis reliability** | The truck breaks down just as often as the pump — chassis matters |

## The Concrete Supply Chain

```
Batch Plant → Ready-Mix Trucks → Job Site → Concrete Pump → Final Placement
```

Your customer is the **pump operator/owner** in this chain. They coordinate with:

- **General contractors** who schedule the pour
- **Ready-mix companies** who deliver the concrete
- **Finishers** who work the placed concrete

Understanding this chain shows the customer you know their world.

## Key Industry Numbers

- U.S. concrete pumping market: **~$4 billion annually**
- Average boom pump works **800–1,200 hours/year**
- Typical useful life of a boom pump: **15–25 years** (with proper maintenance)
- A 2017 model has **~9 years of remaining useful life** — still a strong asset
