| **Chassis** | Kenworth T880 |
| **Pump** | Concord Concrete Pump (boom-mounted) |

## The Value Proposition

### For the Owner-Operator Adding a Unit

> *"This is a proven rig on the most trusted vocational chassis in the industry. You're getting a Concord pump — known for low maintenance costs and easy field service — on a Kenworth T880 that your mechanic already knows how to work on. At a used price point, you're looking at a rig that can cash-flow from day one."*

### For the Fleet Operator Expanding

> *"Adding a 2017 unit at used pricing lets you put another crew to work without the $500K+ commitment of a new build. The T880 chassis has established service intervals your fleet manager can plan around, and Concord parts are readily available across North America."*

### For the Contractor Moving from Line Pumps to Boom Pumps

> *"You've been turning down the bigger jobs or subbing out the boom work. This rig lets you keep that revenue in-house. A mid-range boom on a T880 handles 80% of commercial pours, and the step up in hourly rate from line pump to boom pump pays for the financing."*

## Pricing Framework

Used boom pump pricing depends on hours, boom length, and condition:

| Factor | Impact on Value |
|--------|----------------|
| **Low pumping hours** (<5,000) | Premium — pump has significant life left |
| **Mid hours** (5,000–10,000) | Fair market — may need some wear parts soon |
| **High hours** (10,000+) | Discount — factor in rebuild costs |
| **Recent maintenance records** | Adds 10–15% confidence premium |
| **New wear parts installed** | Reduces buyer's near-term costs |
| **Clean chassis** (no rust, good brakes) | Critical for DOT compliance |

!!! tip "Market Range"
    A 2017 boom pump on a T880 chassis in good condition typically trades in the **$175K–$350K range** depending on boom length, hours, and pump condition.

## Financing Angles

As an equipment finance professional, you can structure the deal to make the numbers irresistible:

### Monthly Payment vs. Monthly Revenue

| Scenario | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Estimated rig value | $200K–$300K (example) |
| 60-month finance at ~7% | ~$4,000–$6,000/month |
| Revenue at 80 hours/month × $175/hr | **$14,000/month gross** |
| Revenue at 120 hours/month × $175/hr | **$21,000/month gross** |

The rig pays for itself if it works **25–35 hours/month**. Most boom pumps work 70–100+ hours/month.

### Depreciation and Tax Benefits

- **Section 179** — may allow full deduction in year of purchase (check current limits)
- **MACRS depreciation** — 5-year property class for concrete pumps
- **Bonus depreciation** — check current tax year provisions

!!! warning "Don't Give Tax Advice"
    Position these as conversation starters: *"Have you talked to your CPA about Section 179? A lot of our customers are surprised at how much they can write off in year one."*

## Objection Handling

### "I'd rather buy a Schwing."

> *"I respect that — Schwing makes excellent equipment. Here's what I'd ask you to consider: this Concord on a T880 gives you comparable pumping performance at a significantly lower cost of ownership. The parts are cheaper, the hydraulics are simpler to service, and you're financing a used unit at a fraction of new Schwing pricing. That delta in monthly payment goes straight to your bottom line."*

### "2017 is getting old."

> *"For a passenger vehicle, sure. For a boom pump, 2017 is mid-life. These rigs run 15–25 years. If the hours are reasonable and the maintenance has been done, you're buying into the sweet spot — past the steep depreciation curve but with a decade of productive life ahead."*

### "I'm worried about maintenance costs."

> *"That's exactly the right question. Two things work in your favor here: Concord designed these pumps for field serviceability — your operator can handle routine maintenance without a factory technician. And the T880 is the most common vocational chassis in America — every Kenworth dealer and most independent shops can service it."*

### "I can't keep it busy enough."

> *"Let's look at the breakeven. At $175/hour with a 4-hour minimum, you need about 7–8 pours a month to cover your payment. Most of our customers are busier than that within 90 days. And the beauty of boom pump work is the hourly rate — even at 60% utilization, the economics work."*

## The Close

The strongest close for this rig ties together three things:

1. **The math works** — show them the payment vs. revenue comparison
2. **The risk is low** — proven chassis, proven pump, mid-life asset with years of production ahead
3. **The timing is right** — construction season, interest rates, available inventory

> *"I've got this rig available now, and the financing is straightforward. Let me send you the specs and we can walk through the numbers this week. What does your schedule look like Thursday?"*
